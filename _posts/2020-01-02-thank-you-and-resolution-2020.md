Hello Skillets

### Looking back at 2019:

Wow!!! What an amazing ride. Looking back at 2019, it’s amazing to see how much we have accomplished in just one year.

The credit for the success of SDE Skills goes to all our members. We are truly a community for members by members. We would like to thank each and every one of you for your support and contributions so far. Be it active participation during the sessions in person or online, or engaging in lively discussions on Slack, or forming study groups and helping each other in their success. Thank you for your time and commitment to making the SDE Skills a success. 

We would also like to thank all volunteers for their active contribution, without whom we cannot be at the place where we are. Multiple members stepped up last year leading sessions and demonstrate their passion to give back to the community.

And last, but not least, we would also like to thank Vivek for all his time and dedication. Vivek’s work is highly commendable. He has taken many sessions and coached many people one on one for their success. He is always available when needed.

### Resolution for the year 2020:

**<center>"Get Upgraded or Get Deprecated!"</center>**

Yes, a simple one-liner resolution, the tagline for SDE Skills. It sounds simple but has a deeper meaning and takes little more to follow. Let’s break it down to understand.

1. **Commit**:  
As with anything else, preparing for job interviews requires commitment. SDE Skills is a vibrant and diverse community. We have members fresh out of college and preparing for an interview for their first job. We have experienced people in the industry looking for a change. Preparing for an interview requires commitment in terms of time. We are all busy with our lives, but taking some time out of our busy schedules to keep ourselves updated will help us in the long run.

2. **Practice**:  
Practice is the key ingredient. The saying “Practice makes perfect” is so true. Practicing helps in refining the knowledge and skills in the area. Even if you are not actively looking to interview, or not even passively looking to change jobs, it's still a good idea to practice interviewing. The more you practice, the better your interviewing skills will be and the better prepared you'll be when it's time for real job interviews. It helps job seekers keep updated with the necessary skills required for an interview and help them succeed.

3. **Step Up**:  
SDE Skills community is driven by its members. We encourage you to volunteer, present the topics in person at meetups, take online sessions, engage actively in discussions on Slack and help fellow community members to succeed. You don’t need to be an expert on a topic to present. Whatever knowledge we have about a topic, teaching and presenting to others will help us hone our knowledge and skills in the area. If we are comfortable presenting and writing code in front of a friendly crowd, standing in front of an interviewer and solving problems will become much more comfortable.


Looking forward to another amazing year where our community will be stronger than before helping members in their success.

Happy Learning & Coding  
SDE Skills Team
