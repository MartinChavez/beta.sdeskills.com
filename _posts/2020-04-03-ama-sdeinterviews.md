For any of you who are either exploring job opportunities or considering a move, questions around the hiring process, preparation strategies, and currently the newly added concerns around coronavirus, are common and often asked across multiple forums on the web. 
This post addresses some of them. The list is compiled based on a Q/A session conducted on April 3rd, 2020 online on SDE skills forum. The session was led by Vivekanand Kirubanandan, who comes with 15+ years of software development, and has been a former Amazon Bar Raiser with ~600+ interviews.

## I'm preparing for Amazon as a fresher and I still have 3 months before my graduation. I'm from a non-CS background, is this a disadvantage? Are DS and Algos enough for a fresher or do they consider system design too? Any specific tip you'd like to give me, specific to my preparation for Amazon?
If it is of any consolation, I am also from a non-CS background (Civil Engineering) to be precise. Amazon will probe you on leadership principles, so make sure you read up on what they are and try to remember incidents where you have embodied these principles in your life so far.

## Is there a minimum years of experience that facebook looks for when hiring senior software engineers (L5) role?
FB levels are E3 (new grad, learning to be independent, solves tech problems where business ambiguity is already resolved, and most technical ambiguity is resolved), E4 (fully independent execution, business ambiguity is mostly resolved, and tech ambiguity is not resolved), E5 is seen as a domain leader ( solves complex business problems by resolving business ambiguity). E5s are pseudo Team leads, E6s are more like Principal Engineers at Amazon, where they identify the business problems, and identify trends / patterns.
So experience years generally doesn’t mean much. E5s can be as few years of experience as 4y or as much as 20+y. E5 is considered a terminal level (you don’t have to move to E6, can stay E5 forever).

## Another question about facebook hiring process. How do we get to know details about the number of parallel interviews we can take? Like product managers can interview for TPM role and PM role in parallel. Some recruiters don’t seem to tell this information. Is there a place it is documented?
I do not know at FB, at Amazon, they generally try not to run parallel interviews.

## Looking at the current situation and circumstances due to coronavirus, how are the companies approaching their recruitment process and what will be your advice to 2020 graduates, will they face a tough time to get into the IT sector?
Good question! While this is not the best of times, we have had this sort of a thing happen multiple times. 2000 dot com bust shook the world, and then the 2008 financial crisis did the same. Anytime there is a shake down, it makes things hard. 

My advice is to focus on the basics. Have your programming skills sharp. Know your basics. Build your portfolio. If you are actively job-hunting, then do that as a full time job. Keep at it. And once you get a job, don’t let that make you complacent. A job is not guaranteed. Many folks who have been top-performers have been let go due to constraints beyond their control.
These are tough times! Remember, this too shall pass!

Just by numbers, after 9+ years of serving the community, we have a strong following of 
* 2200+ members on [Seattle area meetup][3]
* 1300+ members on [San francisco area meetup][4] and 
* 130+ members in our latest local meetup [SDE Skills Toronto][5] that started in September 2019. 

Our meetups are frequent and regular. We meet in-person, each week, and discuss various topics. The part that is impressive is that we are an entirely volunteer driven / volunteer led / volunteer supported group. We run an ultra lean operation, leveraging facilities and infrastructure provided by the county (thank you [KCLS.org][1]). Look at the [list of our presenters][6]

A quick glance at the meetup statistics, we have organized nearly 400 events. Our weekly meetups format has evolved over the years to the current form, where we ask our members to sign up to present any topic of their choosing. Our meetups are extremely inclusive and we actively encourage participation. We cover a broad range of topics from simple data structures to more advanced topics such as system design. 

To support the needs of the broader world-wide community, we have a slack group with 3800+ members. I peeked at the Slack statistics, we have about 200-250 active members at any time, with about 3000+ messages being sent and 20-30 files being uploaded each month. [Click here][2] to get invited to the slack.

Look for our next post where we talk about our plans for 2020.
