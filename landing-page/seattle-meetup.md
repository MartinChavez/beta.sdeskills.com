        <h2 class="section-title">Seattle/Eastside Programming Interview Meetup</h2>      
        <p>Looking to practice coding interviews? You have come to the right place!</p>
        <p>SDE Skills has been operating in the east side for over <strong>9.5</strong> years. We regularly meet each week at one of the east side libraries to practice various programming interview topics.</p>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong> our meetups are full with long waitlists, please do not let that discourage you. I urge you to RSVP, and add yourself to the waitlist. After this, please contact the organizers via a meetup message and introduce yourself. We will review and see if we can sneak you in one of the upcoming meetups.</p>
