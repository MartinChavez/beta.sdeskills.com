		    	<p>The Toronto meetup had our first meetup last October and is still getting its feet! We currently aim to meet every 2nd week (will increase with sufficient interest), we've had a great turn out in our first few meetups and look forward to continuing to grow! This is a great time to join, get to know everyone, and volunteer to run a session!</p>
