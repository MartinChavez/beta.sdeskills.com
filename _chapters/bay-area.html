		    	<p>As one of the largest Tech Hubs, we will be remiss if we did not have a presence in the Bay Area. In 2020, we will be rebooting our offerings, and aim to kickstart a regular series of meetups serving the community. We have been talking to some of the meetups already in flight, and are looking to see if we can supplement them. From a location perspective, we will focus on Sunnyvale/Santa Clara region. If you are interesed in volunteering, presenting ping anyone in the leadership team.</p>
