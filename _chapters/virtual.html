		    	<p>SDE Skills is a global community, with members in over 20 countries. Our members meet virtually on our Slack platform. One of our long running tradition is a weekly LeetCode practice, we have a "bot" that randomly picks 3 LC questions (one easy, one medium and one hard) and posts them in the #leetcode channel. Folks solve, and interact asychronously.</p>
		    	<p>We are looking for a Chapter Lead for our Virtual Chapter. If you are interested in stepping up, please ping <a href="mission-control">Mission Control</a> and we can figure out how to take it forward.
